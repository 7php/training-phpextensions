# About

- I want to learn how to create PHP Extensions from Scratch
- The amazing & prodigious @sgolemon is currently my mentor (see: [https://twitter.com/7php/status/953722250116530176](https://twitter.com/7php/status/953722250116530176))
- This repo will serve as: my workbook & journal

## My Objectives

- Get started with PHP Extensions
- Create a PHP 7 compatible wrapper for [https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb](LMDB) - something similar to [https://github.com/mpremus/lmdb-php](https://github.com/mpremus/lmdb-php)


### Questions For Later (After the initial training is done)

- Is there a different approach to create an extension for multi-process & multi-threaded?
- How to approach the creation of the php extension, so that it's both PHP 5.6+ & PHP 7+ compatible?

## Observations
- Revisiting **Macros** would be an advantage:

    - https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html
